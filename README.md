# Animal Crossing: New Horizons Project

Welcome to my project! In this repository, I’ll walk you through some fun and interesting data visualizations and insights related to the popular Nintendo game **Animal Crossing: New Horizons**.

## Overview
**Animal Crossing: New Horizons** is a life-simulation game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. Released in March 2020, the game became extremely popular during the COVID-19 pandemic as players could visit friends’ islands, build and customize their own islands, and live out their “virtual lives” in a relaxed, online environment.

### Key Features in the Game:
- **Customize Your Character and Island**  
  Players can personalize their character and design their entire island, making it unique to their tastes.
- **Build and Decorate**  
  You can craft furniture, build homes, and arrange your island to your heart’s content.
- **Fishing and Bug Catching**  
  The game offers a relaxing and rewarding fishing and bug-catching experience.
- **Socializing with Villagers**  
  Your island has a variety of villagers, each with unique personalities. Players can befriend them, invite them over, and even celebrate their birthdays.

## Data Visualizations

Here are some of the key visual insights I created based on **Animal Crossing: New Horizons**.

### 1. **Villager Breakdown by Species and Personality**

Animal Crossing features a diverse set of villagers, with 391 unique characters. I’ve created a bar chart that showcases the most popular species and their associated personalities. As you can see, **cats, rabbits, and squirrels** are the top three species, with **frogs** tying for third place.

When you hover over the bars, you'll see the number of villagers in each species and personality, as well as their birthdays.

### 2. **Gender Distribution of Villagers**

I also took a look at the gender distribution of the villagers. While I initially thought there would be more female villagers, it turns out there are more male villagers in total.

### 3. **Build Your Outfit Dashboard**

I attempted to create a “Build Your Outfit” dashboard where players can select various clothing items for their characters. Each item has a specific cost in **bells**, the currency of the game.

Although I wasn’t able to fully implement the functionality to show the image and filter the cost at the same time, the concept is there, and I hope to improve it in the future!
